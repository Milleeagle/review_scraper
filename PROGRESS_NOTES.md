# Progress Notes - Google Places Scraper Simplification

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Simplified the Scraping Strategy
- **Removed complex company search**: No more searching Google then extracting Maps links
- **Direct Google Maps URL approach**: System now expects direct Google Maps URLs as input
- **Focused on Reviews tab navigation**: Added specific logic to find and click "Reviews" tab
- **Implemented Sort by Newest**: Added functionality to click "Sort" dropdown and select "Newest"

### 2. Updated Code
- **Modified `GoogleReviewScraper.cs`**: Updated `ScrapeReviewsAsync()` method with new 5-step process:
  1. Navigate to provided Google Maps URL
  2. Find and click "Reviews" tab
  3. Click "Sort" dropdown and select "Newest"
  4. Scroll to load more reviews
  5. Extract reviews (now sorted by newest first)

### 3. Updated Documentation
- **Enhanced CLAUDE.md**: Updated scraping strategy, added Chrome dependency notes
- **Added configuration details**: Launch profiles, request models, Selenium config

### 4. Testing Status
- ✅ .NET 8.0.414 installed successfully
- ✅ Project builds without errors (2 minor warnings)
- ✅ Application runs on http://localhost:5291
- ❌ Chrome/ChromeDriver dependency prevents full testing (needs admin privileges)
