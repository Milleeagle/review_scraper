# Google Places Scraper - Implementation Status

**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Status:** ‚úÖ FULLY FUNCTIONAL

## Current State

The Google Places Review Scraper has been successfully refactored with a new, simplified implementation that is **85% smaller** and **significantly faster** than the original version.

### What's Working

‚úÖ **GoogleReviewScraperV2** - New simplified scraper (350 lines vs 2,544 lines)
‚úÖ **Place ID Support** - Added new endpoint `/api/reviews/scrape-by-place-id`
‚úÖ **Multi-language Support** - Handles Swedish, English, French, German consent dialogs
‚úÖ **Rating Extraction** - Correctly extracts 1-5 star ratings with multi-language regex
‚úÖ **Deduplication** - Uses HashSet with author+text unique keys
‚úÖ **Fast Performance** - ~18-19 seconds per scrape (vs 2+ minutes with old scraper)
‚úÖ **Comprehensive Data** - Extracts: author, rating, text, time, business responses

### Test Results

**Test 1 - Searchminds (ChIJnytgooPRV0YRTCdMAyVMLt4)**
- ‚úÖ 5 reviews extracted
- ‚úÖ All ratings: 5 stars
- ‚úÖ Swedish language content
- ‚úÖ Business responses included
- ‚è±Ô∏è Execution time: ~18 seconds

**Test 2 - Stures Bilv√•rd (ChIJp4mZMOedX0YRictjTxs8Czg)**
- ‚úÖ 10 reviews extracted
- ‚úÖ Mixed ratings: 1-5 stars
- ‚úÖ Swedish language content
- ‚è±Ô∏è Execution time: ~19 seconds

## Architecture

### Active Components

**Services/GoogleReviewScraperV2.cs** (ACTIVE)
- Simplified Selenium-based scraper
- Chrome headless mode with anti-detection
- Smart consent dialog handling (8 different selectors)
- Multi-language rating extraction
- Proper error handling and logging
- Screenshot capability for debugging

**Controllers/ReviewsController.cs**
- All existing endpoints working
- New endpoint: `POST /api/reviews/scrape-by-place-id`
  - Accepts: `{ "placeId": "ChIJ...", "options": {...} }`
  - Converts Place ID to Google Maps URL format

**Program.cs**
- Uses `GoogleReviewScraperV2` via DI
- Line 10: `builder.Services.AddScoped<IReviewScraper, GoogleReviewScraperV2>();`

### Legacy Components

**Services/GoogleReviewScraper.cs** (INACTIVE)
- Original 2,544-line implementation
- Still in codebase but not used
- Had duplicate review issues
- Overly complex with hundreds of selectors

## Key Implementation Details

### Consent Dialog Handling

The scraper tries multiple selectors in order:
1. `//button[contains(., 'Accept')]`
2. `//button[contains(., 'Reject')]`
3. `//button[contains(., 'Godk√§nn')]` - Swedish Accept
4. `//button[contains(., 'Avvisa')]` - Swedish Reject
5. `//button[@aria-label='Accept all']`
6. `//button[@aria-label='Reject all']`
7. `//form[@action]//button[2]` - Second button in consent forms
8. `//button[contains(@class, 'VfPpkd-LgbsSe')]` - Material button class

### CSS Selectors (From Actual Google Maps HTML)

Based on real HTML structure provided by user:

```csharp
Review container: div[data-review-id] or .jftiEf
Author name: .d4r55
Rating: .kvMYJc (aria-label contains "5 stars" or "5 stj√§rnor")
Review text: .wiI7pd
Relative time: .rsqaWe
Business response: .CDe7pd .wiI7pd
```

### Rating Extraction Patterns

Multi-language regex patterns:
- English: `(\d+)\s*star` ‚Üí "5 stars"
- Swedish: `(\d+)\s*stj√§rn` ‚Üí "5 stj√§rnor"
- French: `(\d+)\s*√©toile` ‚Üí "5 √©toiles"
- German: `(\d+)\s*Stern` ‚Üí "5 Sterne"

### Scraping Flow

1. Navigate to Google Maps URL (5 second wait)
2. Handle consent dialog (try all selectors, 2 second wait)
3. Click Reviews tab (3 second wait)
4. Scroll to load reviews (500ms between scrolls)
5. Extract all review elements
6. Parse individual reviews with error handling
7. Deduplicate using author+text key
8. Return up to maxReviews

## API Endpoints

All endpoints available at `http://localhost:5291` (or 7296 for HTTPS)

### Existing Endpoints
- `GET /api/reviews/search` - Search for company by name/location
- `POST /api/reviews/scrape` - Scrape reviews from Google Maps URL
- `POST /api/reviews/scrape-company` - Search and scrape company
- `POST /api/reviews/scrape-from-url` - Extract company info + scrape
- `GET /api/reviews/test-scrape` - Quick test endpoint
- `POST /api/reviews/test-scrape-post` - Test with POST body

### New Endpoint
- `POST /api/reviews/scrape-by-place-id` - Scrape using Google Place ID
  ```json
  {
    "placeId": "ChIJp4mZMOedX0YRictjTxs8Czg",
    "options": {
      "maxReviews": 10
    }
  }
  ```

## Development Setup

### Requirements
- .NET 8.0 SDK
- Chrome browser or ChromeDriver
- WSL2/Linux environment (tested) or Windows

### Commands

```bash
# Restore dependencies (first time or after adding packages)
dotnet restore

# Build project
dotnet build

# Run application
dotnet run --launch-profile http   # http://localhost:5291
dotnet run --launch-profile https  # https://localhost:7296

# Clean build artifacts
dotnet clean
```

### Environment

- Working directory: `/mnt/c/Users/emilj/source/repos/google_places_scraper`
- Platform: Linux (WSL2)
- OS: Linux 6.6.87.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2
- Not a git repository (yet)

## Known Issues & Solutions

### ‚úÖ SOLVED: NuGet Package Path Conflicts
- **Issue:** Windows paths cached in WSL2 environment
- **Solution:** Run `dotnet restore` to regenerate with Linux paths

### ‚úÖ SOLVED: Consent Dialog Blocking
- **Issue:** Swedish Google consent page not being handled
- **Solution:** Added multi-language consent selectors including "Godk√§nn"

### ‚úÖ SOLVED: Rating Showing 0
- **Issue:** English-only regex pattern didn't match Swedish "stj√§rnor"
- **Solution:** Added multi-language patterns with case-insensitive matching

### ‚úÖ SOLVED: Duplicate Reviews
- **Issue:** Old scraper extracted same reviews multiple times
- **Solution:** V2 uses HashSet with unique author+text key

### ‚úÖ SOLVED: Slow Performance
- **Issue:** Old scraper took 2+ minutes per scrape
- **Solution:** V2 simplified logic completes in ~18 seconds

## Next Steps (If Needed)

### Potential Enhancements
- [ ] Add pagination support for more than 20 reviews
- [ ] Implement request queuing for high-volume usage
- [ ] Add rate limiting to avoid Google blocks
- [ ] Extract review photos/images
- [ ] Parse absolute dates from relative times
